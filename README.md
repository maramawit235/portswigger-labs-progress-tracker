This file tracks my progress through [PortSwigger Web Security Academy](https://portswigger.net/web-security) labs. I focus on web app pentesting, documenting key labs as full writeups (linked below) and logging all solves here for reference. Full writeups are reserved for first-time techniques, complex exploits, or custom tools.

## Level progress
- **Apprentice**: 2 of 61
- **Practitioner**: 10 of 174
- **Expert**: 0 of 39

## Categories Covered

- **Authentication vulnerabilities**: 0/14 lab
- **SQL injection**: 12/18 lab
- **Access control**: 0/13 lab

## Notes
- **Full Writeups**: Only for significant labs (e.g., chained exploits or scripted solutions). See `platforms/portswigger/` for details.
- **Tools Used**: Burp Suite

## How to Read
- **Columns**: 
  - `No`: Sequential lab number.
  - `Date`: When I solved it (YYYY-MM-DD).
  - `Topic`: Vulnerability category (e.g., API Testing, XSS).
  - `Lab Title`: Exact name from PortSwigger.
  - `Difficulty`: Apprentice, Practitioner, or Expert.
  - `Writeup Link`: Links to full writeup (if exists) or "N/A" for quick solves.
